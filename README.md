# HTML/CSS

Repository to record everything I learn in HTML/CSS and all the practice interfaces that I develop. I'm already familiar with some amount of HTML and
beginner level CSS. But I've decided not to take anything for granted and do the basics, and work through the learning journey in a way that helps
me consolidate what I learn.
